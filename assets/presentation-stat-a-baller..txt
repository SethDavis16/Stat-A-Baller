As a group, we first came up with the idea for Stat-A-Baller and used KanBan in Github to organize our project. We held a virtual meeting using Zoom to brainstorm ideas and create a list of features and functions for the application. We used wireframe.cc to create a visual representation of the application, which helped us understand how the different features would work together. Once we had a clear plan in place, we divided the work among our team members and began working on the development of Stat-A-Baller.

Challenges (presenter notes):
To create Stat-A-Baller, our team had to overcome a few challenges. First, we had to collect and organize a large amount of data from various sources. This was time-consuming and challenging, but necessary to provide accurate statistics for NBA players. Next, we had to design a user-friendly interface that was easy to navigate and use for NBA fans. This required careful planning and design to create an intuitive interface that was accessible to users of all skill levels.

Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the statistics was also important. To do this, we had to use a correct API to get accurate data from the provider. Unfortunately, the only free API version we could find was from balldontlie.com, which had outdated statistics. Despite this challenge, we were able to work around it and provide reliable statistics for our users.

Finally, we wanted Stat-A-Baller to have a visually appealing and engaging user interface. To achieve this, we used Bulma.io to design the interface, which helped us maximize its functional aspect and make it aesthetically pleasing. However, due to Bulma's restrictions and the many elements involved, we had to break down the JavaScript into several files and host the "carousel" plugin locally to edit specific variables and functions to get it to work the way we wanted it to. Despite this challenge, we were able to create a visually appealing and engaging user interface for Stat-A-Baller.

Challenge Bullet points:
-Collecting and organizing large amounts of data from various sources
-Creating an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for NBA fans
-Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the statistics provided
-Designing a visually appealing and engaging user interface using Bulma.io and JavaScript.


Successes:
Thanks to our effective communication methods, our team was able to successfully develop Stat-A-Baller. We used texting and Slack to quickly share information and updates, and we held regular meetings to discuss the progress of the project and ensure that everyone was on the same page. These communication strategies allowed us to work efficiently and effectively as a team, which helped us create a successful web application. Additionally, our ability to problem-solve and debug small issues contributed to the success of the initial release.

Success Bullet Points:
